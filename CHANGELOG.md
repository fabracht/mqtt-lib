### Examples
Four comprehensive examples demonstrating real-world usage patterns:
1. **IoT Device Simulator** - Error handling, circuit breakers, retry logic
2. **Smart Home Hub** - Concurrent device management, mTLS authentication
3. **Industrial Sensor Network** - Enterprise security, custom CA, failover
4. **Observability Dashboard** - Metrics collection, HTTP endpoints, monitoring

## [0.3.0] - 2025-08-01

### Added

**Note**: This project was originally created as a showcase for the BeBytes derive macro capabilities,
demonstrating high-performance serialization in real-world MQTT applications. It has evolved into
a full-featured, production-ready MQTT v5.0 platform with both client and broker implementations,
complete with a unified CLI tool that replaces mosquitto.
