- **Advanced security features**:
  - TLS/SSL support with certificate validation
  - Mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication support
  - Custom CA certificate support for enterprise environments
- **Production-ready connection management**:
  - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
  - Session persistence (clean_start=false support)
  - Client-side message queuing for offline scenarios
  - Flow control respecting broker receive maximum limits
- **Comprehensive IoT examples**:
  - IoT device simulator with circuit breaker patterns
  - Smart home hub with concurrent device management
  - Industrial sensor network with failover logic
  - Observability dashboard with real-time metrics collection
- **Testing infrastructure**:
  - Mock client trait for unit testing
  - Property-based testing with Proptest
  - Integration tests with real MQTT broker
  - Comprehensive benchmark suite
- **Advanced tracing and debugging**:
  - Structured logging with tracing integration
  - Comprehensive instrumentation throughout the codebase
  - Performance monitoring capabilities
- **Developer experience**:

  - Callback-based message routing
  - Zero-configuration for common use cases
  - Extensive documentation and examples

### Technical Highlights
- **Zero-copy message handling** using BeBytes derive macros
- **Direct async methods** instead of event loops or actor patterns
- **Comprehensive error handling** with proper error types

- **Memory efficient** with bounded queues and cleanup tasks
- **Production tested** with extensive integration test suite

### Performance
- High-throughput message processing with BeBytes serialization
- Efficient memory usage with zero-copy patterns
- Concurrent connection handling
- Optimized packet parsing and generation

### Dependencies
- `bebytes ^2.6.0` - Core serialization framework
- `tokio ^1.46` - Async runtime
- `rustls ^0.23` - TLS implementation
- `bytes ^1.10` - Efficient byte handling
- `thiserror ^2.0` - Error handling
- `tracing ^0.1` - Structured logging

### Examples
Four comprehensive examples demonstrating real-world usage patterns:
1. **IoT Device Simulator** - Error handling, circuit breakers, retry logic
2. **Smart Home Hub** - Concurrent device management, mTLS authentication
3. **Industrial Sensor Network** - Enterprise security, custom CA, failover
4. **Observability Dashboard** - Metrics collection, HTTP endpoints, monitoring

## [0.3.0] - 2025-07-31

### Added
- **Certificate loading from bytes**: Load TLS certificates from memory (PEM/DER formats)
  - `load_client_cert_pem_bytes()` - Load client certificates from PEM byte arrays
  - `load_client_key_pem_bytes()` - Load private keys from PEM byte arrays  
  - `load_ca_cert_pem_bytes()` - Load CA certificates from PEM byte arrays
  - `load_client_cert_der_bytes()` - Load client certificates from DER byte arrays
  - `load_client_key_der_bytes()` - Load private keys from DER byte arrays
  - `load_ca_cert_der_bytes()` - Load CA certificates from DER byte arrays
- **WebSocket transport support**: Full MQTT over WebSocket implementation
  - WebSocket (ws://) and secure WebSocket (wss://) URL support
  - TLS integration for secure WebSocket connections
  - Custom headers and subprotocol negotiation
  - Client certificate authentication over WebSocket
  - Comprehensive configuration options
- **Property-based testing**: Comprehensive test coverage with Proptest
  - 29 new property-based tests covering edge cases and failure modes
  - Certificate loading robustness testing with arbitrary inputs
  - WebSocket configuration validation across all input domains
  - Memory safety verification for all certificate operations

### Enhanced
- TLS configuration now supports loading certificates from memory for cloud deployments
- WebSocket configuration supports all TLS features (client auth, custom CA, etc.)
- Comprehensive examples showing certificate loading patterns for different deployment scenarios

### Use Cases Enabled
- **Cloud deployments**: Load certificates from Kubernetes secrets, environment variables
- **Browser applications**: MQTT over WebSocket for web-based IoT dashboards
- **Firewall-restricted environments**: WebSocket transport bypasses TCP restrictions
- **Secret management integration**: Load certificates from Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.

**Note**: This project was originally created as a showcase for the BeBytes derive macro capabilities,
demonstrating high-performance serialization in real-world MQTT applications. It has evolved into
a full-featured, production-ready MQTT v5.0 client library suitable for industrial IoT deployments.
