# Contributing to mqtt-v5

## For Human Contributors

### Getting Started

1. **Fork and Clone**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fabriciobracht/mqtt-lib.git
   cd mqtt-lib
   ```

2. **Install Prerequisites**

   - Rust 1.83+ (check with `rustc --version`)
   - cargo-make: `cargo install cargo-make`

3. **Run Tests**

   ```bash
   # Generate test certificates (if needed)
   ./scripts/generate_test_certs.sh

   # Run all tests with cargo-make
   cargo make test
   ```

### Development Workflow

1. **Create an Issue First**

   - Describe what you want to fix/add
   - Wait for feedback (from agents or maintainers)

2. **Development**

   - Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
   - Write code following Rust conventions
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation

3. **Testing**

   ```bash
   # Before committing - run all checks
   cargo make pre-commit

   # Or run individual checks:
   cargo make test     # Run tests
   cargo make clippy   # Run linter
   cargo make fmt      # Format code
   cargo make fmt-check # Check formatting

   # Verify CI will pass
   cargo make ci-verify
   ```

4. **Submit PR**
   - Clear description of changes
   - Reference the issue being fixed

### Code Style

- Follow standard Rust naming conventions
- Use `rustfmt` for formatting
- Prefer `Result<T, E>` over panics
- Use `tracing` for logging, not `println!`
- Document public APIs with examples

### Testing Guidelines

- Unit tests go next to the code
- Integration tests go in `tests/`
- Use property-based tests for edge cases
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both success and failure paths

### MQTT v5.0 Compliance

When implementing MQTT features:

- Reference the [MQTT v5.0 specification](https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/mqtt-v5.0.html)
- Include spec section numbers in comments
- Test against multiple brokers (Mosquitto, Mqttx, etc.)
- Ensure backward compatibility

## Release Process

Releases are managed by me:

1. Update version in `Cargo.toml`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md`
3. Run full test suite: `cargo make ci-verify`
4. Create git tag
5. Publish to crates.io

## Questions?

- Check existing issues first
- Provide minimal reproducible examples
- Include environment details (OS, Rust version)
- Be patient
